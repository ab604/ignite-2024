Day 2 of Ignite internship:

-   Clone this repository

-   Have a look at Jenny Bryan on naming things: [YouTube Video 5 min.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES1LTlnpLMk) and [Slides](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/lectures_2015/01-markdown-git/slides/naming-slides/naming-slides.pdf).

-   Using just the [Itchen Bridge Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itchen_Bridge) create: 

    + A [Quarto document](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) that outputs a Word document with four facts about the Itchen Bridge
    + A [Quarto Revealjs Presentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) with a title slide and four slides about the  Itchen Bridge

- Create a git repository for each of these and push the presentation to Github pages.

- Use the [library search](https://library.soton.ac.uk/homepage) to make a list of Itchen Bridge related items and add them to your Quarto Document.
