## Notes

## 2024-04-10

## Day 3 of Ignite internship:

-   Re-cap days 1 and 2.
-   Cope collection and web searches (project management and research skills)
-   Digitise slides, digital viewer and file naming

## Days 4 & 5 (2024-04-11 & 2024-04-12)

-   Finish gathering information from Cope collection and identify anything you'd like to digitise. Talk to Jeremy and Hannah about digitising any additional documents.
-   Start drafting a webpage, presentation and Word document for The History of the Itchen Bridge using the materials (slides, book references etc.). We'll discuss style, formatting and length next week.

## Presentation idea
- Entirely optional, but one idea for the presentation could be to make it about your internship. Imagine you have to present what you have done and learnt to your family or tutor or even future employer. So you might have a slide giving an overview of creating a website, and another on the Itchen Bridge and how you researched it e.g. Cope collection, 35 mm slide curation, and so on. Can be as few or as many slides as you like, and it can include a link to the final webpage and appear in your CV as a link too.
