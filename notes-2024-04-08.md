Day 1 of Ignite internship, we covered:

-   Installation of Visual Studio code, Git Bash for Windows, Quarto and set-up a Github account

-   We then used Quarto to create a website in VS Code and pushed it to Github Pages.

### Installation links

1.   [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2.  [Github](https://github.com), [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

### File and folders

-   Created folders called `img` for images, and `docs` for our website.

### VSCode tips

-   Using [Visual Editor VSCode](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/vscode/)

-   [VSCode and Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html#overview)

### git local repository and Github remote repository

Guide to git with R, but the contains lots of useful information about git and github: [Happy git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/)

1.  From the git bash terminal type: `git init` to initialize a repository on my laptop.

2.  We can check the status of our repository `git status`

3.  We will create two files `.gitignore` file to track anything we don't want to add to Github on the internet, and `.nojekyll` to overwrite GitHub pages defaults.

4.  Then we will perform an initial add and commit to our repository:

    -   `git add .` this stages all changed files and folders for committing to the repository
    -   `git commit -m "an initial commit"` Commit changed files/folders to the local repository
    -   `git push origin main` Commit to the remote repository (on Github)
